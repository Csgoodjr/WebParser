# WebParser
This is designed to search the web and analyze URLs on different web pages that appear in web-searches. 
In theory, the external links that some webpages have could actually match the search criteria of what you are looking for. So by analyzing tese different links, you can get a more comprehensive search result.

# Other information
In addition to search benefits, this was also designed to gain a deeper knowledge of Python and how to implement classes across different files. While doing this project, I was able to practice making resusable code.
